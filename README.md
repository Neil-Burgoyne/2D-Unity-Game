# CodeClan - Unity/C# Solo Project

For my final project at CodeClan I decided to make a 2D platforming game to gain a greater understanding of C# and game engines.

The project was built using:

- Unity
- Unity Marketplace Assets
- C#

The CodeClan brief was to produce a project that pulled together everything I have learned in the Professional Software Development course.
